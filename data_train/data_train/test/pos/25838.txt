I ordered a cheesecake just because I missed having some authentic ones after having failed attempts in other cafes in China and vietnam . I liked to seek out the foreign made cafes , such as this one with a french taste . It was nice and quiet in the cafe with good music and modern decorations . The layout was wide and free . Â 
There were french guests , a family , beside my table , where the manager , who is also french , kept in conversation with them . I was impressed by the manager ' s presence because he would overlook everything to be quality . The waitresses also spoke english , which was helpful . There were so many choices of desserts that looked so good , but I had already eaten lunch , so I chose my favorite . The_Cheesecake . Yes , it may be pricey , but when a girl has her cravings , a girls gotta eat .
