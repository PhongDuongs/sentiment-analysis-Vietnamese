Second time we visited and it did not disappoint . Located at the end of Le_Duan opposite the Sofitel , this neat little cafe offers a nice spacious interior and comfortable seating , free wifi , friendly staff and of course great drinks !
This cafe is a bit quieter than the other coffee houses which is good for a more intimate gathering .
We ordered an ice chocolate without cream , and a blueberry smoothie . And a green tea tirimisu to munch on .
The ice chocolate was a winner , very chocolate like without the super sugary taste ! It was an original iced chocolate at its best !
The blueberry smoothie was very nice , not too milky or heavy , and served very chilled .
The green tea tirimisu cake was a bit misleading as the green tea flavour was very pronounced but the tirimisu component was missing . It was a nice cake but not what it was said to be .
All in all , fantastic outing at this nice cafe !
