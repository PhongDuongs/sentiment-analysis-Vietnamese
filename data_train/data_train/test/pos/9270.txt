A little off the track but so much worth it . I did not know about it and was introduced to the place by a friend and I felt soooooo luck and privileged ! Food was excellent the first time , good was as excellent the second time . Staff was pro and friendly , and I like to know that the place is run by a NGO that trains people who deserve it . Would surely go back . < a class = ' hashtag-link ' href = ' / ho-chi-minh/hashtag/superb-188556 ' > # superb </a> < a class = ' hashtag-link ' href = ' / ho-chi-minh/hashtag/Vietnamese-Aroma-71988 ' > # Vietnamese_Aroma </a> < a class = ' hashtag-link ' href = ' / ho-chi-minh/hashtag/villa-9188 ' > # villa </a>
