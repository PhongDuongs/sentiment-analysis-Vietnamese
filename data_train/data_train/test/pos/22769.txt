I couldnt wait to go to a pet cafe . This one was a little far from where we live but it was totally worth our drive . The place is very clean for having so many animals and their coffee is actually one of the best we have , wasnt too strong or watery . They have quite a few differnt birds you can hold on the first floor along with a few dogs . On the second floor they have cat and a bunnies . Scattered throughout there are hampsters and frogs in cages . I would definitly recomend this place if you like pets and dont have any allergies .
