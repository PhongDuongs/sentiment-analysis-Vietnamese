Ppl recommend the place and we happen to be close by so decided to go ahead and try .
First mistake , pretty crowded . Gotta make reservation .
However , if you go with a group , buy 5 and got 6th for free .
Anyway , we start browsing around before getting the food . Good selections . From fried rice , pancake , grill shrimp . Lot of desserts .
All of them are tasty and fresh . I think i got three big plate before i hit dessert .
The waiter clear up the table pretty fast . We didnt have it pile up at all .
Desserts was great , fruits was fresh . Other traditional sweet isnt too sweet or strong flavor . Would recommend tourists to come here .
