The meat is marinated just right and cooked perfectly . Very tender and soft . Their fish sauce is the best I tasted in a long time . The vegetables are fresh and so are the noodles . The restaurant is clean . The staffs are attentive and friendly . I highly recommend the place not only the price is decent but the food and the service is second to none . Give it a shot and you won ' t be disappointed .
