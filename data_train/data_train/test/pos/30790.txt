The pizza was a bit thich but it was so crispy . I love the topping . It included green bell pepper , tomato , mayonnaise , mushroom , meat , chicken and more thing that I couldn ' t remember . I ate this pizza with my relatives outside the mall . It was outside so I could see the night sky with twinkle stars and cold windy weather . It is best to eat with fried shrimps and coke .
There are many food stalls in AEON but I haven ' t enjoy all of them yet , so this year I will come back ! Oh , and the pizza , too . Recommend this place to the other traveller to come and try out . You can ' t miss out this place !
