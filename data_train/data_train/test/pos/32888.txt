The location is perfect and easy to access since it ' s located in Royal_City , really convenient .
The cost matches the quality of the food , but maybe the sushi is a little overpriced since the quality was a little off . I don ' t review cost based on how expensive a meal is , but choose a critique that matches the quality of the food / dishes . But overall , you do get what you pay for ^ ^ It ' s a little above above average , but expected because it ' s Japanese .
Quality was great , my only concern was the sushi . But the udon and eel bowl I chose were fantastic and delicious .
Service was great because they kept checking to see if everyone was ok , but did it discreetly . They are also professional and well - dressed too , but I didn ' t like how I could see and hear the chefs because of the location . A little too noisy , but I think a simple wall scroll should suffice . But I recommend the chefs being aware of this problem because I did hear them speak during the meal .
The space is beautiful and exquisite , before being seated , I looked at everything in awe . I wasn ' t rushed to sit down and even admired the restaurant while waiting for food .
