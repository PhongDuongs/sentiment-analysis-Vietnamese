The bountiful set menus are a definite plus with amazing taste . I really enjoy the fusion tastes of korean and american / french mix . The service was excellent because in the set we switched out a pasta that my friends tried already . And it was no problem with the rest of the set menu in tact ~
There are also korean food in the menu but the pasta is a must try ~ also tried their calaone , my first time . Plenty of chicken and cheese , yum : )
The place is so cute in terms of decor ~ looks like a cafe too but definitely a quality for dining in with friends or couples ~ service may be slow on a busy day but refeshments are delightful with bread and honey ~
If you are in the area its definitely worth a try ~
