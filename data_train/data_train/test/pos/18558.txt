Located on main road - it is super easy to get to in what is a central location .
Ordered a lemon sorbet - have been craving for it for yonks and tell you what , it did not disappoint .
The staff were prompt and attentive , and spoke good english too - very impressive
Seriously chilled air cond - very good since i walked there !
The lemon sorbet - it was icey cold , tangy and a touch sweet - all the right flavours and textures for a super great lemon sorbet !
Thoroughly enjoyed it , especially at a price of 24K it is an absolute bargain !
Thanks heaps !
