It ' s the 1st time I came here to try sushi . Quite impressed with the huge salmon at the front door .
At first , we had to order and pay at the counter .
Prices are a little bit high compared to others .
Then , we went upstairs to wait to be served .
Lovely and simple design for a sushi restaurant .
Wait not long for the 1st dish and we really like the way it is decorated and served ! Lovely !
Foods are delicious and fresh .
Will come back here for more ! ! !
