Aside from the very reasonable pricing their teas and cakes are great . I ordered a passion fruit cheesecake . The density of cheese level is perfect , a little on the hard side but didn ' t bother me . The crust was a little off considering it should be crunchy but overall it was very nice . Tea was brew ' d perfectly , enough for two actually . Every portion was generous . Warm vibes . Good location and services . Highly recommended : )
