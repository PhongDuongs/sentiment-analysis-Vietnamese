Location : Far from the main highway and takes a bit of twisting & turning to get to , but no narrow alleys .
Decoration : Gives a Korean atmosphere with privacy from the outside . The interior has a few places to eat but can be cramped if busy . Though this place isn ' t the busiest .
Quality : Food has Korean essence but not real Korean food . Some factors make it off - key so I think it ' s mediocre and ok if you aren ' t looking for anything delicious .
Price : Adequate for normal meals , not mine .
Service : Today could definitely be a lot better , it started with the waitress who got the order wrong . I ordered first , bibimbap . Then my husband ordered his meal and there was a 5 second pause between because I gave my menu to him . He ordered , he wanted rice but the pic he pointed to was soup , then he changed his order to rice , properly this time . He did say no soup in Vietnamese , I know at least that much Vietnamese . The waitress took our order then went into the kitchen . When the food came , there was his tonkatsu rice and soup ... I asked where my food was and she " didn ' t understand " . My husband ordered so it was entirely in Vietnamese , she even confirmed the order with us . I got angry since she only said sorry and wanted me to eat the soup and ignore my request for the bibimbap . She ran back in the kitchen and later there was the bibimbap . Very ugly and unlike the other post on here , I felt cheated since I ordered the same dish that had many things missing .
We then said we don ' t want the soup but she refused . So angrily ate the meal , then when it came time to pay she offered a discount when I was outside . But told my husband the order was written down so we were wrong . When she came out to say good bye , she said " I hope you will come again " . I was really angry at this remark and decided to be extremely truthful , the complete opposite of her . I could see in her eyes she didn ' t mean it so that annoyed me more . I answered " I won ' t be coming again " . Then she said " See you again " and I replied " No thank you " and motioned for her to remove a piece of rice on her chin .
So rude to keep up the game of fake " kindness " . Don ' t butter me up with fake compliments to make things worse and blame the customer . Never coming again and extremely annoyed with this service .
One more thing , when the chili sauce was jammed , she said " may I help ? " and I never said " yes " . She put loads of chili sauce by removing the cap and previously applied a lot of soy sauce using a spoon ! Drenched in condiments ! Too much sodium intake too ! Unhealthy ! She eats it like that ? No wonder her face was large and puffed , too much salt ! I was in shock . As I am a practitioner of natural skin health ( meaning no botox / fillers/plastic surgery ) , knowing about what not to do is important . Her upstairs is a spa too ( there ' s a sign ) so why did she do this ? Omg . Koreans don ' t eat it like this , eww . I wonder what was up with her ? ?
