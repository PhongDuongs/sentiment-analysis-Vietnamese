Đà lạt phố coffee . The name reminds everyone about one of the most romantic cities in Viet_Nam but the view in this coffee restaurant is not that good . It ' s so noisy and the design is same as other coffee shops like Moc_Mien and Countryhouse ... The drinks are terrible compare to the price and the view of the restaurant , I expect much better quality . Maybe not come back here ...
