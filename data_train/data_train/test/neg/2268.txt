Arrived early but waited 15mins due to not professional service staff allow a group of cheaters to take our booking although mobile number used for booking are different . Foods are normal and service plates on common buffet table are too small most of time food are emptied and not refilled well . Fire on bbq stove are weak likely staff are new and inexperienced to setup . Servicing of orders are slow and restaurant is too small and over crowded . Overall rating for restaurant if slightly below average , alot more yo improve .
