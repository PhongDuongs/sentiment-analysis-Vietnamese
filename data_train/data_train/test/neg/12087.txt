Second shot for this restaurant for a late lunch .
First time was average . This time was even worst . Staff are sitting and chatting to each other , the soup was awful . No cooking skills at all , all seems to be proceesed . And it is pretty dirty . 60,000 for a handful of egg noodles , bad quality chicken and powder broth ... I would expect a little more . Never again !
