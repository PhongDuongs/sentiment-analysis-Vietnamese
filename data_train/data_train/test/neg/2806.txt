This place is definitely a luxury sushi place . Howwever , it ' s still very unreasonably expensive for local people here . The avarage for one can be up to 1,000,000 vnd . The restaurant is not really noticable in the street but the style is pretty unique . The food is well - decorated and very good . I highly recommend to give it a try but once again , watch out the price !
