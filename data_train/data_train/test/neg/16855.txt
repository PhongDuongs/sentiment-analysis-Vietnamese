I ' m staying next door at DaiA Hotel and would have probably made this my goto coffee spot but was cheated on my first day . I paid for a ca phe sua da which was 12.000 with 102.000 . The attendant would not offer change and said it was right showing me an orange bill ( 10.000 and a 2.000 bill ) . The 100.000 bill is green which is what I paid with .
I suggest tourists with limited Vietnamese stay away from this location . Better coffee and service elsewhere .
