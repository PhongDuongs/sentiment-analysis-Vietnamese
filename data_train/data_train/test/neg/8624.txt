Came here tonight ( 23/03/2016 ) for a few drinks with friends . Got greeted at the door with some really friendy people who showed us in and sat us down upstairs . Then a young waitress with bluey green hair came over to take our order , who didn ' t show a smile and just chucked the menus at us without saying anything . We didn ' t mind as much but didnt feel very welcome either . Everything was fine until one of us asked if the shop did decaf tea and the waitress started giving him attitude . When drinks were brought over , they came with some condensed milk in a little glass jar but when asked if it was milk , she replied in a very snide tone like " what did you think it was ? " . Would understand if it had been a long day for her at that time but giving customers attitude and talking back to them like that is very unprofessional and disrespecful . Hopefully something will be done about this , otherwise we ' d steer clear of this place whenever she ' s around .
