Very basic facilities . Unprofessional staff , Cheeky owner . My boyfriendand I had an Aroma_Massage and a Traditional_Thai_Massage . The aroma was ok , the Thai wasn ' t good . The therapists don ' t wash their hands before massaging your head and face .
Also , so safe to put your belongings ( had a bad feeling about that and couldn ' t relax , when I read the other review today in which a lady says money was missing when she went out , I understood I could be worried ! )
Massages are cheap ( I won ' t agree to pay more in regards to the service offered though ) , but as she probably thought we were tourists , when it comes to the payment , she just looked at me and said " How much ? " . I answered she had to tell me . And she became very pushy about giving tips for the staff . Never again ! < a class = ' hashtag-link ' href = ' / ho-chi-minh/hashtag/massage-22340 ' > # massage </a> < a class = ' hashtag-link ' href = ' / ho-chi-minh/hashtag/Thai-massage-188310 ' > # Thai massage </a>
