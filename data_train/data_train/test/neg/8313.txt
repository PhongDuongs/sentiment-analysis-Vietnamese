When you arrive , you have to park your motorbike about 20m away from the restaurant then walk . Not really convenient . And the costs for parking ? ? ? ? 10K VND ! ! ! ! ! !   Never paid this much for a restaurant So EXPENSIVE and you have to walk ... .
The atmosphere and environment is not bad . very spacious and MASSIVE_TV_SCREEN with a catwalk which is unique . . thats nice .
The food : average quality . Not much to commment about
The beer : WOW ! expensive . 9 bottles of Corona cost me $ 855,000 ! ! ! My god !  
Honestly , its not worth the visit as the total costs outweight the large spacious and average service .
HOPS Beer_Garden , POC_POC , and Shooters are better options in my opinion . They also offer promotions
