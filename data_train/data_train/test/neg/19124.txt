The clay pot that my eel & rice came in , had a lot of character . It was cracked at the bottom from overuse and held together with a metal restraining belt .
It was very hot so it continued to cook the rice and make it crispy . I left it in too long , so it ended up burning my rice .
The service could be better .
Food is ok , but a bit pricy . They charge 10% on top of the menu price .
Eel & rice , edameme , miso soup , a row of tuna sushi and a cup of hot tea = 335k vnd
