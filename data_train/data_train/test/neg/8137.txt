It ' s been a long time since i wrote my last review because i have not much tome recently . But after i went here for lunch i was sooo disappointed that i just had to take the time writing one . Well where to start ... i came here because my friend wanted to go . Looking on the website you could see the promotion for 02 pax for just 109k and i thought ok let ' s give it a try . When we wanted to order the girl said promotion is not valid and i asked her why and referred to the website . She just said well it is old . I just thought at least BK should update their website as people get confused with it when it is not correct . Next i asked her if there is any promotion today . Note today is Saturday . She just replied to me on Wednesday there is a promotion so you can come again ... well i gave up on this and we ordered 2 different combos but she only typed in 1 . Had to correct her again . Finally the order was fone and we went to the table seeing the advertisement to give our thoughts about BK . While waiting for our order i thought ok . I will do the survey to get the free burger as promised . It took arojnd 5min and when i finished and had the promotion code i wanted to get the free burger and again that girl . Sorry ... you dont get any fre burger because it is not valid anymore . WTF ... dont keep fu * * * with me . Everything they promised and advertised is just a lie . And the food was not good . Cold and fries not fresh . Service was bad because they just put the food on table . No smile . No wishes etc . Straws were old i assume so they re - use old straws . BK ... i wish u all the best . But after all the scandal and that service i am sure u will leave the market soon . Not only losing the market share but getting a huge image loss . Good luck BK . I used to like to go to BK actually when i lived in Europe . Bb
