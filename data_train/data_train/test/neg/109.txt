They serve fried noodles with beef at VND 120,000 and my wife asked to change it to seafood for the very simple reason that i don ' t eat beef . We are , of course , expected to pay more but guess how much more the restaurant quoted ? Another VND 300,000 more which makes the whole dish to come up to VND 420,000 ! This is worse than robbery because they have no ethics at all ! Even some robbers have code of honour but this restaurant does not . We , of course , did not take up the offer because i think this restaurant are selective about their customers and they don ' t care . This is daylight robbery !
